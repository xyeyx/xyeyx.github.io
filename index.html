<p>Welcome to my personal website! In this minimalist website you find a couple of useful information about myself and my work. </p>
<p>I am an economist with expertise in the fields of global value chain, sustainability, environmental footprint, monetary economics and finance. I live in Utrecht (the Netherlands) and Ningbo (China). For job/assignment offering and other business contact, you can send me private message through <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yexey/" target="_blank">linkedin</a>.</p>
<p>I teach tutorials for quite a variety of international business and general economics courses in University of Groningen (the Netherlands).
